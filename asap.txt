Subject: Request for Project Confirmation for College Credit

Good Morning Sir,

I hope you're doing well.

I need to present a project from my internship to my college in order to secure the required academic credits. Could you please let me know what project I can work on and present by the end of my internship?

I'd appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as possible, as my college has set deadlines, and I haven’t received a response from my manager despite following up.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Aryan Madhavi
